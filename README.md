Football Analysis Projects
==========================

Overview
--------

This repository is dedicated to football data analysis, showcasing various Jupyter notebooks that detail the handling and visualization of football data from multiple perspectives. Through these projects, we explore different facets of football analytics, including creating sophisticated pass maps, evaluating player performance metrics, and more, using Python and libraries like Matplotlib and mplsoccer.

## Pass_map 

The `Pass_map` directory contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets used for creating advanced pass maps (passing network map). Key components include:

- `1. Pass map creating v1.20240221.ipynb`: Notebook for pass map visualization.
- `data/`: Directory containing raw event data files for match Man City 1:1 Chelsea | Premier League | Season 2023-2024 | 2024-02-17
- `img/`: Directory containing resulting `pass_map.jpeg` and reference map from the Athletic teamplate the `Athletic pass map.jpeg`
